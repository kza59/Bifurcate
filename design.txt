GAME DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
In the game, everything that is able to take damage will be named an entity.
These entities all have bodies.
There will be game-caused effects on bodies, and player-caused effects on bodies.
This means that even when the player is doing nothing, there will still be events occuring in the game.
Whenever there is an input from the player, something will happen. That is, the event will be processed, and there may or may not be effects on different bodies.

All bodies are assigned a name, along with various other characteristics.

For example, if we have an entity, called Blob:

Blob -> Entity -> Enemy -> Body -> Position : s
                                -> Velocity : v
                                -> Acceleration : a
                                -> Mass : m
                  Characteristics -> Name: Blob
                                  -> Color: Green
        Stats -----------> HP : 100
                        -> HP regen :0.1
                        -> Dex : 1
                        -> Atk : 1
                        -> Def : 1
                        -> Spd : 0.5
